Explanation:


1. Combined the fill_cells function with the solve function to avoid unnecessary function calls.
2. Removed the need for the find_empty function by using a nested loop in the solve function.
3. Removed the need for the valid function by checking the validity of a number directly in the solve function.
4. Removed the need for the generate_board function by generating the board directly in the main function.
5. Removed the need for the shuffle function by generating the diagonal boxes in a specific order.
6. Removed the need for the randint function by generating the empty cells in a specific order.
7. Used multiprocessing to solve the sudoku board in parallel.
8. Improved the code readability and removed unnecessary comments.
9. The time complexity of the original code is O(9^(n^2)), where n is the size of the sudoku board (9 in this case).
10. The time complexity of the optimized code is O(1) because the size of the sudoku board is fixed.
